<!--  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>-->
  <p>We are sourcing short, four-page papers focusing on all aspects of object-oriented learning. We welcome submissions on:</p>

  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Learning unsupervised object-centric representations,</li>
  <li>Leveraging object-centric representations in RL,</li>
  <li>The interface between objects and causal reasoning,</li>
  <li>Object-centric approaches to exploration,</li>
  <li>Inductive biases which favor object representations,</li>
  <li>Temporal "objects" (i.e. events),</li>
  <li>Datasets or environments for learning and testing object-centric reasoning,</li>
  <li>Object-centric aspects of human cognition,</li>
  <li>Subjects which are otherwise relevant to object-oriented learning.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b>We particularly encourage submissions from students from groups that are underrepresented at machine learning conferences</b>, including: gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and institution. We are pleased to be able to offer a limited number of travel grants to student presenters from these groups; if you would like to apply for financial assistance, please indicate this when submitting your paper.</p>

  <p> Submission Policy: </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Submissions should be a maximum of four pages, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. </li>
  <li> Papers should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. </li>
  <li>Papers should use <a href='https://github.com/oolworkshop/oolworkshop.github.io/blob/master/ool2020.zip'>this style file</a>.</li>
  <li> Dual submission policy: we welcome submissions that have been published or are currently under review at other venues, including both full conference papers and workshops. However, all submissions should be shortened to four pages. </li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria: Papers will be reviewed for topicality, clarity, correctness, and novelty; however, we welcome submissions which are still work-in-progress. Papers which are longer than four pages, clearly off-topic, or not anonymized will be rejected without review.</li>
  <li>Papers accepted to the workshop will not be considered archival publications.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
